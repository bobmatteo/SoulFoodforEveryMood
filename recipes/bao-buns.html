          <li>
            Mix together the flour, caster sugar and ½ tsp salt in a large bowl
            (see tip). Dissolve the yeast and a pinch of sugar in 1 tbsp warm
            water, then add it to the flour with the milk, sunflower oil, rice
            vinegar and 200ml water. Mix into a dough, adding a little extra
            water if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for
            10-15 mins, or until smooth. Put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with
            a damp cloth and leave to rise for 2 hrs, or until doubled in size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tip the dough out onto a clean work surface and punch it down.
            Flatten the dough with your hands, then sprinkle over the baking
            powder and knead for 5 mins.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll out the dough into a long sausage shape, about 3cm thick, then
            cut into pieces that are about 3cm wide – you should have 18. In the
            palm of your hand, roll each piece of dough into a ball and leave to
            rest for 2-3 mins.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a rolling pin to roll out each ball, one by one, into an oval
            shape about 3-4mm thick. Rub the surface of the dough ovals with oil
            and brush a little oil over a chopstick. Place the oiled chopstick
            in the centre of each oval. Fold the dough over the chopstick, then
            slowly pull out the chopstick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cut 12 squares of baking parchment and put a bun on each. Transfer
            to a baking tray, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove in
            a warm place for 1 hr 30 mins, or until doubled in size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a large steamer over a medium-high heat. Steam the buns for 8
            mins until puffed up (you’ll need to do this in batches).
